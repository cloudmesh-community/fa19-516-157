The Apple data center in Maiden, North Carolina announced its construction in 2009. Although there is no information online stating the exact year that this data center went into operation, there are plenty information about the year it started construction. 

There are two sources online [WorldTopDataCenters](http://worldstopdatacenters.com/apple-maiden-north-carolina/) and [Baxtel](https://baxtel.com/data-center/apple-maiden-north-carolina) that have different information about this data center's energy consumption. [WorldTopDataCenters](http://worldstopdatacenters.com/apple-maiden-north-carolina/) states that this facility has IT load of 20,000kW and [Baxtel](https://baxtel.com/data-center/apple-maiden-north-carolina) states that this facility has IT load of 100,000kW. The report from [WorldTopDataCenters](http://worldstopdatacenters.com/apple-maiden-north-carolina/) is from 2014 and Apple has announced its plan of expanding the Maiden facility since then, though the publish date of  [Baxtel](https://baxtel.com/data-center/apple-maiden-north-carolina)'s report is unknown, there is good chance that [Baxtel](https://baxtel.com/data-center/apple-maiden-north-carolina)'s report is after the facility's expansion. 

According to [Power usage effectiveness in data centers: Overloaded and
underachieving](https://cedmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Power-usage-effectiveness-in-data-centers-overloaded-and-underachieving.pdf) from The Electricity Journal. Apple's Maiden datacenter has PUE of 1.1 which is quite efficient. The local electricity cost in Maiden, North Carolina is $0.08/kWh. Calculation shows that Apple's Maiden data center has yearly cost of 81.8M dollars and 542,510 tons of yearly CO2 footprint which is equal to 119,600 cars.

**_Wind_**

Wind energy is harvested from wind turbines, the gigantic turbines are oftern planted in areas such as plains that have winds throughout the year. The wind will push the propellars which then turns the electric generator to generate electricity. It is a form of converting mechanical power to electricity. 

According to Savvas' article [Wind Turbines Set To Deliver The Edge Data Centre Needs Of The Future?](https://data-economy.com/wind-turbines-set-to-deliver-the-edge-data-centre-needs-of-the-future/) Green IT- Das Systemhaus has a data center called WindCORES in Paderborn, Germany and 92% of the data center's energy comes from wind turbines yet the facility is still able to offer service with reliability level of 99.98%.

According to this [Article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2165831/china-steps-green-energy-push-revised-renewable-target-35-2030) from South China Morning Post. China has aimed for renewable energy to account for at least 35 percent of electricity consumption by 2030. The government also required non-compliant firms to pay fines to energy providers, the fines are used to pay for the government subsidy to those energy providers. The government also required some provinces to increase their target of non-hydro power consumption.

The rear door heat exchangers are great alternatives to using chillers in data centers. According to [Data Center RackCooling with Rear-doorHeat Exchanger](https://datacenters.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/rdhx-doe-femp.pdf) from U.S. Department of Energy, the circulating water within the device will absorb the heat from server fans before it is discharged into the data center. According to the same article, the device will increase reliability and reduce cost since it is a passive device meaning it has no moving parts.
