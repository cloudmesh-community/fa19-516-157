First upgrade pip to latest version\
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`


In my case I only have python 3.7.4 installed so the following command by default installs python3 venv\
Navigate to desired directory then type\
`python -m venv ENV3`\
ENV3 stands for the environment name, user can change it to any other name

To activate virtual environment, enter\
`.\ENV3\Scripts\activate`

To deactivate virtual environment, simply type\
`deactivate`
